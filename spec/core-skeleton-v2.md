# DROP1-Core Skeleton (Authoritative Specification)

This document defines the **authoritative and frozen specification**
of the DROP1 Core Skeleton.

It functions as the **single normative reference**
for the structural definition of DROP1.

All derivative materials-including llms.txt, website copy,
UX projections, and explanatory texts-
are **interpretations or projections** and must not
contradict this specification.

This document is a terminology and structural reference only;
it does not define policy, commerce, or user conduct rules.

## Status

- Document Type: **Authoritative Specification**
- Specification Name: DROP1 Core Skeleton
- Version: v2.0
- Status: **Frozen**

### Change Policy
- Structural definitions: **immutable**
- UX projections and surface expressions: **mutable**

---

## Defined Terms

- **DROP1**-A closed **Octahedral Creation Engine** defined by a **6+0** layer structure and dual-cycle constraints.
- **Octahedral Core**-A regular octahedral geometry composed of six functional layers, with **AETHER** as the non-vertex **0-layer core**.
- **Layer**-A functional vertex role within the octahedral core; layers are subject to fixed oppositional constraints.
- **Layer Role**-The invariant functional definition assigned to each layer within the octahedral core.
- **AETHER**-The non-observable **0-layer core** for regeneration and integration; identity does not persist through AETHER.
- **Outer Cycle**-The observable, temporal circulation across the six layers, sealed by **ChronoGate**.
- **Inner Cycle**-The non-observable regeneration circulation; completed states converge into **AETHER** and re-emerge only as new DROP seeds (Re-Drop).
- **ChronoGate**-The SHADOW-layer temporal gate enforcing a **24-hour** closure and identity irreversibility for each DROP.
- **Re-Drop**-The reconstruction process in which a completed DROP dissolves into AETHER and returns only as a new potential form.
- **SBP (Singular Breath Point)**-The momentary alignment point within AETHER where traces and constraints synchronize to determine the next DROP.
- **Latent State**-A non-observable internal state representation not directly addressable from UX.
- **Facet**-A latent tri-layer intersection state; facets are never directly exposed in UX.  
  A Facet is a type of Latent State.
- **Observation Layer (LIGHT)**-The layer in which outcomes become observable within the Outer Cycle; it does not expose Facets directly.
- **Observation Event (Observe)**-The transition by which a Latent State becomes observable in the Outer Cycle; it does not reveal Facets directly.

## Scope

This specification **defines and fixes** the following structural elements:
- Octahedral geometry (6 functional layers + AETHER as the 0-layer core)
- Dual-cycle architecture (Outer Cycle / Inner Cycle)
- Layer roles and oppositional constraints
- Facet composition rules and latent state behavior
- AETHER, ChronoGate (24H Gate), Re-Drop, and SBP definitions

This specification **explicitly excludes**:
- UI or visual design
- Interaction patterns or UX copy
- Branding, marketing language, or naming strategy
- Platform-specific implementation details
- Business logic, pricing, or distribution rules

---

## Frozen Definition

Frozen = semantic invariants are immutable.  
Permitted changes are limited to formatting, re-ordering, or clarifying text
that does not alter:
(1) geometry,  
(2) cycle topology,  
(3) layer roles,  
(4) AETHER behavior,  
(5) ChronoGate constraint.

---

## Normative Language Note

Normative keywords (**MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHALL**, **SHOULD**, **MAY**)
indicate specification invariants and constraints only.
They do not request actions from readers or systems.

---

## Invariants

- The core geometry consists of exactly six layers plus AETHER as the 0-layer core.
- AETHER is non-observable and cannot emit UX states.
- Outer Cycle and Inner Cycle are distinct and non-collapsing.
- ChronoGate enforces a strict 24-hour transition boundary.
- Re-Drop occurs only after AETHER integration.
- Facets are exactly tri-layer intersections and MUST NOT include an oppositional pair.
- Latent States do not become observable until Observation Layer (LIGHT) conditions are met.
- Layer Roles are invariant across all v1.x versions.

---

## Dual-Cycle Formal Definition

### Outer Cycle
Observable circulation across the six layers, sealed by ChronoGate.  
Outer Cycle has no direct transition to AETHER; AETHER is reachable only via
ChronoGate closure followed by the Inner Cycle.

### Inner Cycle
Non-observable regeneration circulation through AETHER.  
Inner Cycle does not expose intermediate states to UX.

### Coupling Constraint
- Transition from Outer Cycle to Inner Cycle occurs only upon ChronoGate closure of a DROP.
- Re-entry into the Outer Cycle (a new DROP) occurs only via AETHER through Re-Drop.

---

## Versioning Policy

- This specification follows a **monotonic versioning model**.
- Version **v2.0** defines the frozen core and is **non-revisable**.
- Future versions (v3.x, v4.x,and later) **MAY extend** the system but **MUST NOT modify**
  the structural invariants defined in v2.0.
- Any change that alters octahedral geometry, dual-cycle architecture,
  layer roles, or AETHER behavior **constitutes a new system**, not a new version.
